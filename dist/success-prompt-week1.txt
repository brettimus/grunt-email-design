Hi Person,

I noticed you posted an ask on Reed
Switchboard a week ago. Did things work out? If they did, why
not let your community know that you made a connection.

If you haven't gotten any takers yet, donâ€™t
worry. Here are some ideas:

* Cast a wider net by cross-posting your offer on Twitter of
Facebook.

* Set an alert ( http://reed.switchboardhq.com/alerts ) to let
you know if someone posts the match for your ask.

If you have any comments, questions, or
suggestions, please reply to this email and let me know!

Happy Connecting,

Aria
